               Just a little bit about me. I was born in Belarus, Russia but moved here at the age of 2. So I am fluent in Russian and English. I work at Microsoft as a Business Admin and am going to school to pursue a Bachelors Degree in Information Systems and Technology. I have a family of 7, I am the second child. I absolutely love living in Washington. Everything about our PNW is stunning. I love hiking, roadtrips, coffee shops, and good movies. I'm big on traveling, someday I want to travel the whole world.
