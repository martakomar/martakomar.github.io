        My experience with Washington is just home. I love the cool fresh ocean air. For me, it's the most ideal
        getaway. We pack blankets, chairs, wood, hotdogs, and smores and always have the best time. I enjoy that the
        grey sky reflects the water. I love the cliffs and venturing out along the shore. It's my favorite place in our
        Pacific Northwest.

        “The sea is emotion incarnate. It loves, hates, and weeps. It defies all attempts to capture it with words and
        rejects all shackles. No matter what you say about it, there is always that which you can't.”
        ― Christopher Paolini, Eragon
