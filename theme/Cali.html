        My experience with California Ocean was a blast. The waves were just tremendous and the water was an extreme sky blue color. The Santa Monica Pier was in view. The sky and ocean seemed to almost blend in color. There was a California vibe about this place. Teenagers playing beachball in the sand, surfers catching the waves.
