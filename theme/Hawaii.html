                My experience with Hawaii was just bliss. Hawaii is just straight out of a post-card. I remember floating on Waikiki Beach thinking, "this can't be real.. this water is just too warm and just to blue." Millions of sailboats out on the water, Honolulu hotels all around, and volcanoes literally in view. A Hawaii beach is something ALL should experience.
